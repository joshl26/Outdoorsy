Outdoorsy is a full-stack website project where users can create and review campgrounds.
In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account. This project was coded from scratch by myself and completed as part of Colt Steele's web dev bootcamp course on udemy.

This project is being created created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js is used to handle authentication.


## Functionalities

>Everyone can view the camps and reviews without signing up or logging in.

>The user will have to login to edit the campground details or any comments.

>The user can only edit/delete the campgrounds and comments that they have added.

>All the data will pe persistent and is stored in the awazon cloud.

## Technologies Used:

>HTML5 - markup language for creating web pages and web applications

>CSS3 - used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language

>Bootstrap - free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications quickly

>jQuery - cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML

>DOM Manipulation - is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document

>Node.js - pen-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side

>Express.js - for building web applications and APIs and connecting middleware

>REST - REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services

>MongoDB - open-source cross-platform document-oriented NoSQL database program to store details like users info, campgrounds info and comments

>PassportJS - authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application
