Outdoorsy is a full-stack website project where users can create and review campsites. To review or create a campsite, you must have an account.

This project has been created utilizing the technologies listed below.


## Functionalities

>Everyone can view the camps and reviews without signing up or logging in.

>The user will have to log in to edit the campsite details or any comments.

>The user can only edit/delete the campsites and comments that they have added.

>All the data will be persistent and stored in the Amazon cloud.

## Technologies Used:

>HTML5 - A markup language for creating web pages and web applications.

>CSS3 - used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.

>Bootstrap - A free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications quickly.

>jQuery - Cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.

>DOM Manipulation - is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.

>Node.js - Open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

>Express.js - For building web applications and APIs and connecting middleware.

>Joi - Used for schema description and data validation.

>Swagger-UI/JSDOC - Powerful UI interface for documenting, testing and displaying API endpoints.

>Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams which illustrate the sequence of events between objects within this app.  

>Helmet - Helps secure Express apps by setting HTTP response headers.

>REST - REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services.

>MongoDB - Open-source cross-platform document-oriented NoSQL database program to store details like user info, campsites info and comments.

>PassportJS - Authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped into any Express-based web application.

>Data Associations - Associating user data with the respective campsites and comments using the reference method.

>Render.com - Cloud platform as a service used as a web application deployment model.

>AWS - Mongodb is hosted on Amazon ec2 instance.
